## Leetcode Problems

- **Two Sum (Hash Maps)**: This problem introduces you to the concept of using hash maps to reduce time complexity.

- **3Sum (Two Pointers)**: This problem helps you understand how to use pointers to scan through an array in a systematic way.

- **Reverse Linked List (In-place Reversal of a Linked List)**: This problem is a classic linked list problem and gives you practice manipulating linked list pointers.

- **Sliding Window Maximum (Two Heaps/Sliding Window)**: This problem combines two concepts - heaps and the sliding window technique.

- **Merge Intervals (Merge Intervals)**: This problem helps you understand the concept of interval merging, which comes up quite often in interviews.

- **Top K Frequent Elements (Top K Elements)**: This problem introduces you to the concept of heap-based priority queues and their application.

- **Search in Rotated Sorted Array (Modified Binary Search)**: This problem gives you practice with binary search, particularly in a non-standard context.

- **Subsets (Subsets/Backtracking)**: This problem introduces you to the concept of generating all subsets of a set, a common pattern for many problems involving backtracking.

- **Coin Change (Dynamic Programming)**: This problem is a good introduction to dynamic programming, a powerful technique for solving optimization problems.

- **Course Schedule (Topological Sort)**: This problem introduces you to the concept of topological sort, an important algorithm for dealing with problems involving dependencies or sequencing.
