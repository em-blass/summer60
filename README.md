# Summer60 Challenge

Welcome to the Summer60 Challenge! This project is aimed at improving your Python programming and problem-solving skills by working through a series of LeetCode problems and other coding exercises. The goal is to complete 40 LeetCode problems and achieve 20 deep focus hours over a period of 60 days, from 5/8 to 8/1.

This repository contains my solutions and notes for each problem, as well as blog posts detailing my progress and learning.

## Goals

- Complete 40 LeetCode problems with a deep understanding of each solution.
- Achieve 20 deep focus hours.

## Schedule

The challenge consists of three primary stages, each with specific focus areas:

1. Review Python fundamentals, data structures, and algorithms (20 days)
 - My focus will be on the following:

   * Data Structures
   * Dynamic Array
   * Linked List
   * Stack & Queue
   * Hash Tables
   * Binary Search Tree
   * Binary Heaps & Priority Queue
   * Graphs
   * Trie
   * Algorithms
   * Bit Manipulation & Numbers (unsigned vs. signed numbers)
   Stability in Sorting
   * Mergesort
   * Quicksort
   * Heapsort (in-place for O(1) space)
   * Binary Search
   * Selections (Kth Smallest Elements: Sort, QuickSelect, Mediums of Mediums)
   * Permutations
   * Subsets
   * BFS Graph
   * DFS Graph
   * Dijkstra's Algorithm (understand the concept, no need to implement)
   * Tree Traversals (BFS, DFS: in-order, pre-order, post-order; recursive and iterative)
   * External Sort (know the concept)
   * NP-Complete (understand the concept)
   * Topological Sort
   * Detecting cycles in undirected and directed graphs
   * Counting connected components in a graph
   * Finding strongly connected components in a graph

2. Solve LeetCode problems (40 days)
   * Implement an ArrayList from scratch
   * Reverse a linked list
   * Implement a Stack & Queue using Array
   * Implement a HashTable with simple hashing functions
   * Implement a Graph using Adjacency List, and then write functions for BFS & DFS
   * Write the binary search algorithm both recursively and iteratively
   * Write the merge sort algorithm
   * Write the quicksort algorithm
   * Print binary tree using DFS (in-order, pre-order, and post-order) and BFS
   * Memorize time & space complexities for common algorithms
   * Implement a trie
   * Learn important bit manipulation tricks

3. Blog about progress (periodically throughout the challenge)
 - As I work through the challenge, I will document my progress, learning, and insights in blog posts. This will help solidify my understanding and serve as a valuable resource for future reference.

## Repository Structure

- `solutions/`: Contains Python code for each LeetCode problem solved during the challenge.
- `notes/`: Contains notes on thought processes, algorithms used, and mistakes made for each problem.
- `blog_posts/`: Contains blog posts detailing my progress and learning throughout the challenge.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Follow the schedule and complete each day's tasks.
2. For each LeetCode problem, attempt to solve it in 20-30 minutes.
3. Take notes on your thought process, algorithms used, and mistakes made.
4. Understand the time and space complexity of your solution.
5. Compare your solution with the one provided in the `solutions/` directory.
6. Write periodic blog posts to document your progress and learning.

## Conclusion

This project is intended to enhance my Python programming and problem-solving skills. By adhering to the schedule and finishing the tasks, I hope to acquire a thorough comprehension of diverse data structures and algorithms, which will equip me to confront coding challenges in the future. You can also utilize this guide to support you in your endeavors!
