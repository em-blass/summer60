# Summer60 Challenge

Welcome to the Summer60 Challenge! This project is aimed at improving your Python programming and problem-solving skills by working through a series of LeetCode problems and other coding exercises. The goal is to complete 40 LeetCode problems and achieve 20 deep focus hours over a period of 60 days, from 5/8 to 8/1.

This repository contains my solutions and notes for each problem, as well as blog posts detailing my progress and learning.

## Goals

- Complete 40 LeetCode problems with a deep understanding of each solution.
- Achieve 20 deep focus hours.

## Schedule

The challenge is divided into three main parts:

1. Reviewing Python and data structure / algorithm basics (20 days)
2. Completing LeetCode problems (40 days)
3. Blogging about progress (periodically throughout the challenge)

For a detailed day-by-day schedule, please refer to the [project overview](https://em-blass.github.io/summer60/).

## Repository Structure

- `solutions/`: Contains Python code for each LeetCode problem solved during the challenge.
- `notes/`: Contains notes on thought processes, algorithms used, and mistakes made for each problem.
- `blog_posts/`: Contains blog posts detailing my progress and learning throughout the challenge.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Follow the schedule and complete each day's tasks.
2. For each LeetCode problem, attempt to solve it in 20-30 minutes.
3. Take notes on your thought process, algorithms used, and mistakes made.
4. Understand the time and space complexity of your solution.
5. Compare your solution with the one provided in the `solutions/` directory.
6. Write periodic blog posts to document your progress and learning.

## Conclusion

This project is designed to help you improve your Python programming and problem-solving skills. By following the schedule and completing the tasks, you'll gain a deep understanding of various data structures and algorithms, and be well-equipped to tackle coding challenges in the future. Good luck!
