            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Summer60 Challenge! This project aims to improve your Python programming and problem-solving skills by working through a series of LeetCode problems and other coding exercises. The goal is to complete 40 LeetCode problems and achieve 20 deep focus hours over a period of 60 days, from 5/8 to 8/1.</p>
